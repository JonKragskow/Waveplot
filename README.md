CITATION

## Running locally

Each web app is in `apps/name_app.py`, where `name` changes based on the app. Supplemental functions are given in `apps/name.py`. 

To run the code, first install dependencies via `pip`

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and then run the `index.py` file

```
python3 index.py
```

A local copy of waveplot should then be served at the address printed to the terminal.
